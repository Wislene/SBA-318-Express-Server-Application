This is a small Node and Express server appplication for a dinner party with three users having the choice to pick an appetizer, main course, and dessert for their dinner meal.

This Node and Express Server Application demonstrates key concepts such as using custom middleware, Restful API creation, rendering views with a template engine, and interacting with the API via HTML forms. The application features three main data categories: users, posts, and comments, and provide full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionality for each.

Below is more information about each of the parts that were used:

1. Custom Middleware: two custom middleware functions for logging requests and handling errors.
2. Error-Handling Middleware: a middleware function to handle errors.
3. Restful API: Endpoints for users, posts, and comments with full Crud operations.
4. Template Engine: EJS is used to render views.
5. HTML Forms: Forms are used to interact with the API.
6. Static File: CSS files are served to style the views. One photo was used.
7. Data Filtering: Query parameters are used for data filtering.
8. Route Parameters: Utilized where appropriate for dynamic routing.
